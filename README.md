# SportsDada: Sports Analytics Website

## Description:
SportsDada contains the compilation of most of the work I've done in the sports analytics space. Beginning from [my first blog post](https://sportsdadas.blogspot.com/2019/07/less-than-five-percent-i-love-nba-my.html) on which NBA teams with less than a 5% chance of competing for a title should do so, to [my most recent project](https://nbasalary.sportsdada.net/) on how salary allocation affects NBA success. Most of these have been solo, some have been done with groups. I always try my best to give credit where it is due. Hopefully you enjoy the breakdown and analysis and hopefully you learn a thing or two you didn't know before! Enjoy!
